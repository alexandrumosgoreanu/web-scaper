It was my first time getting a perm in the States. I was not sure because recently I got a bad haircut from a salon in the Magnificent Mile!
The stylist here cut off blunt end of my hair for free and he was super meticulous and detailed.
Yes, he asked for tip at the end but it is part of American culture, so be it. - KeyOne J 4 months ago  Flag as inappropriate Tommy is always very patient to my hair. He has been taking care of my hair for a few years and I am very happy with all the styles he has done for me. This is the most recent style. - Anna X 5 months ago  Flag as inappropriate Very accommodating and they fit you in the schedule quickly.  I appreciate that since I don’t always know my schedule too far in advance.  I think 15% tip is standard so I’m not sure why people are complaining.  Tommy spends a lot of time giving you a quality haircut. - Mary W Write a Review Read More Gallery Contact Us Contact Call now (814) 954-5812 Address Get directions 135 East Beaver Avenue State College, PA 16801 USA Business Hours Mon: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Tue: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Wed: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Thu: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Fri: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Sat: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Sun: 10:00 AM – 8:00 PM Report abuse Header photo by Top salon Powered by Google  Menu  Call  Directions Contact Us ✕ Message sent.
